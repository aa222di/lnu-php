## Assignment 1
I tried to fulfil all test cases but was quite late with that last ones dealing with session hijacking and didn't quite understand the instructions and
how to test it well. 

Found assignment easy at first but with time rather challenging as I had to restructure code many times to get the right arquitecture, i.e. put messages in view instead of model.
I really liked to gather all variables like POST, COOKIE and GET in the view. Also, with time, found it nice to use the controller just as a kind of app-navigation without itäs own intelligence so to say.




## Assignment 2
I have tested the application manually and I pass all the tests but it won't work with the Automated Test Application.
